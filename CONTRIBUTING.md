# Contributing Guidelines

Contributions welcome!

**Before spending lots of time on something, ask for feedback on your idea first!**

Please search issues and pull requests before adding something new to avoid duplicating efforts and conversations.

This project welcomes non-code contributions, too! The following types of contributions are welcome:

- **Ideas**: participate in an issue thread or start your own to have your voice heard.
- **Writing**: contribute your expertise in an area by helping expand the included content.
- **Copy editing**: fix typos, clarify language, and generally improve the quality of the content.
- **Formatting**: help keep content easy to read with consistent formatting.

## Code Style

This repository uses [`eslint`][eslint-url] to maintain code style and consistency and avoid style arguments. `npm test` runs `eslint` so you don't have to!


## Rules

There are a few basic ground rules for collaborators:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.
1. **Non-master branches** ought to be used for ongoing work.
1. **External API changes and significant modifications** ought to be subject to an **internal pull request** to solicit feedback from other contributors.
1. Internal pull requests to solicit feedback are *encouraged* for any other non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.
1. Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code style.

## Releases

Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer.

## Changes to this arrangement

This is an experiment and feedback is welcome! This document may also be subject to pull requests or changes by contributors where you believe you have something valuable to add or change.
